# Support

This document explains how to get help with the **Compost the Workshop** site and tools.

The project is experimental and evolving alongside the underlying essay, so feedback and questions are welcome.

## Before you open a request

Please check:

- The `README.md` for setup and usage instructions.
- The `TODO.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` to see if what you need is already planned or recently changed.

## Getting help with the site

Use this if you have questions or issues related to:

- Building or running the Eleventy site.
- Content issues (typos, broken links, confusing instructions).
- Design or accessibility concerns.

You can:

- Open an issue on the repositorys issue tracker (recommended for bugs and feature requests).
- Or email **mail@brennanbrown.ca** with:
  - A short description of the problem or question.
  - Steps to reproduce (if its a bug).
  - Your browser and operating system (for display or accessibility issues).

## Getting help with the Rewild Journal CLI

Use this if you have problems running `python rewild.py` or are unsure how the journaling flow works.

When asking for help, please include:

- Your operating system and Python version (`python --version`).
- The exact command you ran.
- The full error message (if there is one).
- Whether you changed the default `--output-dir` or any project files.

## Accessibility and inclusion

If you encounter barriers to using the site or tools (for example, screen reader issues, motion sensitivity, colour contrast problems, or physical constraints that make certain practices difficult), please reach out.

- Describe the barrier and any assistive technology you are using.
- If possible, include screenshots or short descriptions of where the issue appears.

Accessibility feedback is prioritized, and the project aims to treat all bodies as environmental and welcome.

## Response expectations

This is a small, personal project maintained alongside other work. Response times may vary, but thoughtful feedback is appreciated and will help guide future revisions.
