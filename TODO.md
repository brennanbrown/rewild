# TODO

- [x] Flesh out Framework overview content based on the essay.
- [x] Design the Practices collection structure and metadata tags and add first practice pages.
- [x] Add initial individual practice pages (Freewriting as Rewilding, Succession Writing).
- [x] Draft Wild Minds workshop overview content.
- [x] Expand the Access and Ecologies page with concrete adaptations and examples.
- [x] Populate Resources with a core reading list.
- [x] Add basic typography and layout styling in `src/styles.css`.
- [x] Document build and run instructions in a README.
- [x] Add additional practice pages and, if desired, individual framework subpages (including Watershed Writing, Mycelial Networks, Composting as Revision, and Writing with the Cycles).

Future evolution will likely focus on refining content, expanding practices, and iterating on accessibility and design rather than initial setup.
