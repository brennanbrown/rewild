# Access and Ecologies

This project treats all bodies as environmental. Disabled ecologies are not an add-on but a core way of understanding how people meet places.

Drawing on disability justice and work such as Sunaura Taylor's *Disabled Ecologies*, this site assumes that ecological awareness can arise through many pathways: direct sensory engagement, memory, imagination, technology, and shared stories.

## Commitments

- **No single "ideal" body.**  
  Practices do not assume the ability to hike, sit still for long periods, write by hand, or tolerate bright light and noise.

- **Multiple modes.**  
  Exercises can be done through typing, speech-to-text, audio notes, or collaborative documents, and many can be completed from a seated or lying position.

- **Every space is ecological.**  
  Classrooms with fluorescent lights, bedrooms, hospital rooms, buses, and online platforms are treated as environments worth reading and writing with.

- **Access-first design.**  
  Access notes are built into practices from the beginning rather than added as afterthoughts.

## Adapting practices

When you use or adapt practices from this site, consider:

- What barriers might this activity pose (movement, sensory load, time, technology)?
- How could the same ecological attention happen from a different position or with different tools?
- How can participants share access needs and collectively shape the space?

Instructors are encouraged to treat access decisions as part of environmental thinking: whose bodies and ways of sensing are centred, and how might the workshop redistribute care and attention?

Every practice on the site will eventually include specific access notes so that participation does not depend on a single idealized way of moving, sensing, or writing.
