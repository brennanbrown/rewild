# Session 1: Ecology of Mind

**Theme:** Freewriting as rewilding practice.

## Location ideas

- A conventional classroom or quiet indoor space.
- Anywhere students already gather: a hallway, study space, or common room.

## Environmental attunement (1015 minutes)

- Invite participants to close their eyes (if comfortable) and list what they can hear, feel, and smell.
- Ask them to notice the difference between what is closest to their bodies and what is far away.

## Practices

- [Freewriting as Rewilding](/practices/freewriting-as-rewilding/)
- Optional: [Succession Writing](/practices/succession-writing/) as a follow-up.

## Reflection

- How did freewriting feel different when framed as rewilding rather than a test of skill?
- What surprised you about your own thought patterns?
