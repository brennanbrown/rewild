# Session 5: Composting and Succession

**Theme:** Revision as transformation rather than correction.

## Location ideas

- Any quiet space where participants can spread out drafts or devices.

## Environmental attunement (1015 minutes)

- Invite participants to notice evidence of previous uses of the room: marks on tables, worn carpet, posters.
- Connect this to how texts carry layers of previous versions.

## Practices

- [Composting as Revision](/practices/composting-revision/)
- [Succession Writing](/practices/succession-writing/) applied to an earlier draft.

## Reflection

- What changed in your relationship to your work when you treated it as compost or succession rather than a fixed product?
