# Session 2: Nature-as-Text

**Theme:** Reading environments as primary texts.

## Location ideas

- Courtyard, campus green, or nearby park.
- Urban street corner, bus stop, or mall atrium.

## Environmental attunement (1015 minutes)

- Ask participants to list everything moving in the space: leaves, people, traffic, shadows.
- Invite them to imagine the spaces past and future.

## Practices

- [Watershed Writing](/practices/watershed-writing/)
- Future: field journal exercise (to be added).

## Reflection

- What did you notice when you treated this place as a text?
- How does this change how you read written texts about place?
