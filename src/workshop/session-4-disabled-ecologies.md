# Session 4: Disabled Ecologies

**Theme:** Access, micro-environments, and crip intimacy with place.

## Location ideas

- Intentionally chosen accessible space (or fully online meeting).

## Environmental attunement (1015 minutes)

- Map micro-environments that are accessible from where participants are: window views, corners of the room, sounds beyond walls.

## Practices

- Adapt [Freewriting as Rewilding](/practices/freewriting-as-rewilding/) or [Succession Writing](/practices/succession-writing/) to focus on a very small area.
- Group discussion of access as an ecological design choice.

## Reflection

- How does thinking about access change your sense of what counts as "nature"?
- What forms of ecological connection are possible from where you are right now?
