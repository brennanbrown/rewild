# Session 3: Indigenous and Queer Lenses

**Theme:** Relationship, hybridity, and questioning the "natural."

## Location ideas

- Any accessible indoor space where discussion feels safe.

## Environmental attunement (1015 minutes)

- Invite participants to notice who and what is centred in the space.
- Ask: whose stories does this room hold? Whose does it exclude?

## Practices

- Reading and discussion of one or more Indigenous and/or Queer ecological texts.
- A hybrid-form writing prompt that blends modes (list, letter, scene, essay).

## Reflection

- How do Indigenous and Queer perspectives shift your sense of what counts as environmental writing?
- What boundaries in your own work feel ready to be crossed?
