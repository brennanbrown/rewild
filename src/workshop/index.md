# Wild Minds Workshop

The Wild Minds workshop model reimagines the creative writing classroom as a moving, adaptive, ecological space.

Rather than treating the classroom as the only site of learning, this model treats campus and neighbourhood microclimates as potential habitats for writing: greenhouses, courtyards, stairwells, bus stops, archives, drainage ditches, and more.

## Core elements

- **Rotating locations**  
  Sessions move between different environments when possible, including accessible interior spaces. Each location is approached as a text to be read and responded to.

- **Environmental attunement**  
  Every meeting begins with 10–15 minutes of sensory inventory and reflection on the past, present, and future of the place, including more-than-human presences.

- **Ecological practices**  
  Freewriting, succession writing, field journaling, and other exercises are used to cultivate relational attention rather than just polished products.

- **Accessible design**  
  Locations and activities are planned with access in mind, including alternatives for participants who cannot easily move through outdoor or uneven spaces.

- **Portfolio and process**  
  Assessment emphasizes interconnected portfolios and reflective writing over isolated, graded pieces.

## A sample arc

This model can be adapted to different course lengths. One possible six-session arc:

1. [Ecology of Mind](/workshop/session-1-ecology-of-mind/)
2. [Nature-as-Text](/workshop/session-2-nature-as-text/)
3. [Indigenous and Queer Lenses](/workshop/session-3-indigenous-queer/)
4. [Disabled Ecologies](/workshop/session-4-disabled-ecologies/)
5. [Composting and Succession](/workshop/session-5-composting-succession/)
6. [Reflection and Futures](/workshop/session-6-reflection-futures/)

Each session page offers location ideas, attunement prompts, linked practices, and reflection questions. Instructors and independent learners can adapt this structure to their own institutions, schedules, and communities.
