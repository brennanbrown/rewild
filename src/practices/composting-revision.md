# Composting as Revision

Composting treats "failed" or stuck writing as material for new growth. Instead of correcting a draft line by line, you break it down into pieces, discard what has no energy, and recombine what remains into fresh configurations.

## Access notes

<div class="callout callout-access">

- You can compost either printed pages or digital text.
- If cutting paper is not accessible, copy the text into a new document and separate it into lines or phrases you can move around.
- This can be done individually or as a group exercise, with each person composting their own piece or trading drafts (with consent).

## Steps

1. **Select material**
   - Choose a piece of writing that feels stuck or "not working" but still matters to you.

2. **Break it down**
   - Divide the text into small units: sentences, phrases, or even single images.
   - On paper, cut the text into strips. Digitally, put each unit on its own line or card.

3. **Discard whats dead**
   - Remove units that feel flat, clich	7, or purely functional.
   - Trust your gut: what has no life or energy can be composted out.

4. **Notice what still moves**
   - Look at the remaining units and notice which ones feel vivid, strange, or emotionally charged.
   - Group these by resonance: similar images, tones, or questions.

5. **Recombine**
   - Arrange units into a new sequence, allowing surprising juxtapositions.
   - Add a few "activator" elements (concrete sensory details, active verbs) where the new piece needs heat.

6. **Let it rest**
   - Set the new arrangement aside for a while before returning to it with fresh eyes.

## Reflection

<div class="callout callout-reflection">

Reflect on:

- What did you learn about your original piece by taking it apart?
- Which images or lines survived the compost heap, and why?
- How does the new piece feel different in tone or focus from the old one?

## Theory roots

<div class="callout callout-theory">

This practice comes directly from the essays discussion of composting: the idea that our minds and drafts are like compost piles where experience breaks down into fertile soil. Drawing on Natalie Goldbergs work, composting as revision treats discarded writing not as waste but as nutrient-rich material for future growth.
