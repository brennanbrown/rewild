# Mycelial Networks and Rhizomatic Connections

This practice uses the metaphor of mycelial networksthe "woodwide web" connecting trees and plantsto map how ideas communicate beneath the surface. Instead of a top-down outline, you create a web where concepts connect in multiple directions.

## Access notes

<div class="callout callout-access">

- You can do this on paper or using a digital mind-mapping tool or simple text editor.
- If drawing lines is not comfortable, number ideas and note connections in a list (e.g., "1 1, 1 3, 2 4...").
- This practice works well from a fixed position: at a desk, in bed, or seated outside.

## Steps

1. **Choose a central mycelium**
   - Write a central idea, question, or image in the middle of a page (or as item 0 in a list).

2. **Grow outward**
   - As new thoughts arise, write them around the central idea, without worrying about order.
   - Treat each as a node: a phrase, image, memory, or concept.

3. **Draw connections**
   - For each new node, ask: what else on this page does it relate to?
   - Draw lines between related nodes, or note the connection in brackets ("2  related to 5: both about care").

4. **Label relationships**
   - On or near each connection, add a word or two describing the relationship: contrast, echo, cause, memory, opposition, question/answer.

5. **Follow a path**
   - Choose one pathway through the web (e.g., central idea  4  7  9) and freewrite along that route, noticing how moving through connections shapes meaning.

## Reflection

<div class="callout callout-reflection">

Ask yourself:

- Which nodes became hubs with many connections?
- Were there isolated nodes that might be seeds for a different piece?
- How did following a path through the network change what you thought you were writing about?

## Theory roots

<div class="callout callout-theory">

This practice is rooted in the essays discussion of mycelial networks and the "woodwide web," where fungi connect plants and exchange resources. It also aligns with rhizomatic thinking: ideas spreading sideways rather than climbing a single hierarchy. Mapping writing in this way foregrounds relationship, reciprocity, and non-linear growth.
