# Field Journal: Nature-as-Text

This practice treats your surroundings as a text and the page as a field notebook. Instead of writing an essay about nature, you make quick, concrete notes about the place you are inwhether that's a park, a bus stop, a hallway, or your bedroom.

## Access notes

<div class="callout callout-access">

- You can complete this practice indoors or outdoors.
- If writing by hand is tiring, type into a document using the same headings, or dictate notes with your voice.
- If visual detail is less accessible, focus on sound, temperature, texture, and other senses.

</div>

## Steps

1. **Choose a spot**
   - Sit, stand, or lie somewhere you can remain for at least 10 minutes.
   - This could be a window seat, a park bench, a car, a waiting room, or outside your building.

2. **Set up your field page**
   - Use the template below as a guide. You can copy it into your own notebook or adapt it digitally.

   <div class="field-journal" aria-label="Field journal template">
     <div class="field-journal-tab">NATURE-AS-TEXT</div>
     <div class="field-journal-header">
       <div>
         <div class="field-journal-label">Field journal</div>
         <div class="field-journal-title">&nbsp;</div>
       </div>
       <div class="field-journal-meta">
         <span>DATE: __________________</span>
         <span>TIME: __________</span>
       </div>
     </div>
     <div class="field-journal-meta field-journal-meta-row">
       <span>LOCATION: _______________________________</span>
       <span>WEATHER: __________________</span>
     </div>
     <div class="field-journal-body">
       <p><strong>More-than-human presences:</strong> birds, plants, insects, water, machines, other forces.</p>
       <p><strong>Noticed details:</strong> sounds, movements, textures, smells, temperatures, light/shadow.</p>
       <p><strong>Questions:</strong> what stories might this place be telling? what histories are hinted at?</p>
     </div>
   </div>

3. **Observe and note** (1015 minutes)
   - Fill your page with short, concrete notes under headings like:
     - More-than-human presences
     - Human activity
     - Surfaces and edges (ground, walls, thresholds)
     - Temporal clues (what tells you the time of day or season?)

4. **Underline what pulls at you**
   - After writing, underline or highlight 315 details that feel charged, strange, or alive.

5. **Freewrite from one detail**
   - Choose one underlined detail and freewrite for 5 minutes, beginning with that image or phrase.

## Reflection

<div class="callout callout-reflection">

Consider:

- How did treating this place as a field site change what you noticed?
- What surprised you about the more-than-human presences around you?
- How might these notes become the seed of a poem, story, or essay?

</div>

## Theory roots

<div class="callout callout-theory">

This practice grows from the Nature-as-Text strand and the essay's discussion of field journals and ecoliteracy. It echoes exercises where students document plants, birds, and built environments as texts, cultivating attention to the specific, embodied realities of place.
