# Watershed Writing

Watershed writing adapts the image of a watershed—many small streams flowing into a single river—to trace how seemingly separate ideas converge. Instead of forcing a linear outline, you allow multiple headwaters of thought to run downhill until they meet.

## Access notes

<div class="callout callout-access">

- This practice can be done indoors or outdoors, with pen and paper, notebook, or a digital document.
- If writing by hand is difficult, create separate text blocks (or bullets) for each "stream" in a digital document and later rearrange them.
- If drawing lines is not accessible, label each stream with a simple identifier (A, B, C ...) and note where they intersect in text.

## Steps

1. **Gather headwaters**
   - On a page, write 33 words, phrases, or images at the top, spaced apart. These are your headwaters: separate starting points like memories, questions, sensations, or quotes.

2. **Let each stream flow**
   - Under each headwater, write downward in a column, letting associations and thoughts branch from that starting point.
   - Do not worry yet about connecting the streams; simply follow each path.

3. **Notice convergence**
   - As you write, mark (with circles, asterisks, or digital comments) any moments where two or more streams seem to touch: similar images, shared emotions, recurring questions.

4. **Merge flows**
   - Start a new section on the same page or a fresh document.
   - Bring together sentences, phrases, or images from each stream where you noticed convergence.
   - Let them form a single "river" of writing, moving between them without forcing transitions to be perfect.

5. **Name the watershed**
   - Give this combined piece a working title that reflects what all the streams seemed to be flowing toward.

## Reflection

<div class="callout callout-reflection">

Consider:

- Which headwater produced the strongest or most surprising stream?
- Where did separate streams unexpectedly meet?
- What did you discover only after you brought the flows together?

## Theory roots

<div class="callout callout-theory">

This practice is inspired by the watershed metaphor in the essay: an area where many small inputs of water gather into a shared outlet. Writing from multiple headwaters mirrors how experiences, memories, and places flow together into a single piece. It encourages you to see connections across what first appears separatea key skill in ecological thinking.
