# Succession Writing

Succession writing adapts the ecological idea of successionfields becoming meadows, then shrubs, then forestsinto a staged writing practice. Instead of trying to draft and polish at once, you move through phases: quick pioneers, developing patterns, complex relationships, and a temporary "climax" form.

## Access notes

<div class="callout callout-access">

- You can complete all four stages in one sitting or spread them across days or weeks.
- If handwriting is difficult, type or dictate each stage into a separate document or section.
- If longer sessions are not accessible, shorten each stage to 3-5 minutes and trust that even brief succession is still succession.

</div>

## Stages

1. **Pioneer stage (5-10 minutes)**
   - Generate raw material quickly.
   - Focus on immediate impressions, simple sentences, and concrete images.
   - Do not plan structure; imagine early colonizing plants arriving wherever they can.

2. **Early community (5-10 minutes)**
   - Re-read the pioneer writing.
   - Circle or highlight words, images, or lines that carry energy.
   - Begin connecting these in new short paragraphs or stanzas, noticing emerging patterns.

3. **Developing ecosystem (10-15 minutes)**
   - Choose one or two of the emerging patterns and develop them.
   - Introduce metaphor, layered description, or shifts in perspective.
   - Allow different parts of the text to relate to each other: echoes, contrasts, returns.

4. **Temporary climax (optional 10-15 minutes)**
   - Shape what you have into a more continuous piece: a scene, an essay fragment, a poem, or a hybrid form.
   - Aim for a version that feels temporarily stable, not final. This is a mature community, not a monument.

## Reflection

<div class="callout callout-reflection">

Consider:

- How did your focus change between stages?
- What disappeared, and what persisted, as you moved from pioneers to a more complex piece?
- How might future "disturbances" (feedback, new experiences, time away) restart succession in this work?

</div>

## Theory roots

<div class="callout callout-theory">

This practice is adapted from the ecological succession metaphor in the essay. Each stage parallels how plant communities prepare conditions for what comes next, suggesting that discarded drafts and abandoned sentences are not failures but soil for future growth.
