# Writing with the Cycles

This practice translates seasonal cyclesspring, summer, autumn, winterinto stages of a writing process. Instead of expecting a piece to be born fully formed, you move through generative, developing, harvesting, and resting phases.

You can complete all four phases in one extended session or spread them over days, weeks, or even a semester.

## Access notes

<div class="callout callout-access">

- The "seasons" here are metaphorical; you do not need to be outside or aligned with actual weather.
- You can track the phases in a single notebook or digital document, clearly marking each season.
- If longer work periods are not accessible, shorten each phase to 510 minutes and let the cycle repeat more often.

## Phases

1. **Spring 2 Generative**
   - Rapidly generate new material without judgment: lists, images, fragments, questions.
   - Focus on abundance rather than coherence.

2. **Summer 2 Developing**
   - Choose a portion of the spring material that feels alive.
   - Develop it with fuller scenes, richer description, and deeper emotional or conceptual exploration.

3. **Autumn 2 Harvesting**
   - Read what you have and decide what to keep, what to move, and what to set aside.
   - Shape structure: order sections, clarify through-lines, prune redundancies.

4. **Winter 2 Resting**
   - Step back from active revision.
   - Read gently, make minimal notes, and allow the piece to lie fallow before the next cycle.

## Reflection

<div class="callout callout-reflection">

Consider:

- Which phase felt most natural to you? Which was hardest to inhabit?
- How does thinking in cycles change your sense of "writers block" or "finished" work?
- Where in your life do you notice similar cycles of activity and rest?

</div>

## Theory roots

<div class="callout callout-theory">

This practice draws on the essays discussion of cycles: narrative arcs, temperaments, ecological succession, and seasonal change. It emphasizes that dormancy and rest are as necessary as growth, and that writing, like ecosystems, moves through repeating phases rather than a single linear path to completion.
