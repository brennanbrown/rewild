# Compost the Workshop

This site explores how to rewild creative writing pedagogy by treating the mind as an ecosystem and the classroom as habitat. It draws on ecological, decolonial, queer, and disabled perspectives to imagine new ways of writing with the more-than-human world.

## Begin here

Take a few minutes to notice the environment you are in right now. This might be a bedroom, a bus, a classroom, a hospital room, or a path outdoors.

1. Set a timer for five minutes.
2. Without trying to be poetic, list everything you can sense: sounds, textures, temperatures, smells, the way light falls, the way air moves.
3. When the timer ends, choose one detail that surprised you and write a short paragraph beginning from that detail.

## Choose a path

- If you are an instructor, visit the [Framework](/framework/) and [Wild Minds Workshop](/workshop/) sections.
- If you are a writer, explore the [Practices](/practices/) section and try an exercise.
- If you are curious about the theory, read through the [Framework](/framework/) and [Resources](/resources/).
