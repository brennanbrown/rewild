# About Brennan Kenneth Brown

Brennan Kenneth Brown (he/him) is a Queer Métis author and web developer based in Calgary, Alberta.

He founded [Write Club](https://writeclub.ca/), a creative collective that has raised funds for literacy nonprofits. His work spans poetry, literary criticism, and independent journalism, with over a decade of writing publicly on Medium and nine published books.

Brennan runs [Berry House](https://berryhouse.ca/), a values-driven studio building accessible JAMstack websites while offering pro bono support to marginalized communities.

## Current writing

Brennan publishes longform essays on tech, culture, and identity nearly every day on [Medium](https://medium.com/@brennanbrown), with over 180 stories written since 2015.

Some recent pieces include:

- **"Move to a Better Internet in 2026"** – on why platforms like Medium, Tumblr, and NeoCities still matter.
- **"You will never do anything productive or meaningful with your life"** – on the liberation of realizing you cannot waste your time.
- **"The Three Times the World Nearly Ended"** – on ordinary people whose choices quietly saved us all.

## Books

Brennan7s featured book, *Prairie Boyspirit: An NDN Memoir*, is a series of eleven essays about life as a Queer Métis undergrad, and how identity emerges through circling relations with the lands of Western Canada.
