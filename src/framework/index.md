# Framework

This section outlines an ecological approach to creative writing pedagogy, adapted from the essay "Compost the Workshop: Rewilding Creative Writing in the Anthropocene."

The framework is organized into five interwoven strands:

1. [Ecology of Mind](/framework/ecology-of-mind/): freewriting as rewilding practice.
2. [Nature-as-Text](/framework/nature-as-text/): reading the world beyond the page.
3. [Indigenous and Queer Lenses](/framework/indigenous-and-queer-lenses/): expanding environmental imagination.
4. [Access in Wilderness](/framework/access-in-wilderness/): disabled ecologies and the writing body.
5. [Wild Minds Workshop](/framework/wild-minds-workshop/): ecological approaches to teaching and workshopping.

Each strand has its own page with more detail and links to practices you can try on your own or with a group.
