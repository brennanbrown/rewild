# Ecology of Mind: Freewriting as Rewilding Practice

This strand treats the writing mind as an ecosystem that needs both wildness and tending. Rather than producing only polished workshop pieces, writers are invited to practice generative, exploratory work that follows associative paths and honours cycles of abundance and dormancy.

## Focus

- Freewriting as an "organic, developmental process".
- Trusting messy drafts and non-linear thinking as necessary phases.
- Recognizing walking, staring out windows, and daydreaming as composting thought.

## Practices to try

- [Freewriting as Rewilding](/practices/freewriting-as-rewilding/)
- [Succession Writing](/practices/succession-writing/)
- [Watershed Writing](/practices/watershed-writing/)
- [Mycelial Networks and Rhizomatic Connections](/practices/mycelial-networks/)
- [Composting as Revision](/practices/composting-revision/)
- [Writing with the Cycles](/practices/writing-with-the-cycles/)

## For instructors

- Build in regular freewriting time without sharing or grading.
- Frame pauses, walks, and silent observation as part of the work, not avoidance.
- Encourage students to bring "failed" drafts for composting exercises rather than only near-final work.

## For solo writers

- Establish a gentle, regular freewriting practice where nothing needs to be good.
- Treat old notebooks and drafts as compost piles rather than trash.
- Notice your own creative cycles and plan work that respects times of rest.
