# Indigenous and Queer Lenses: Expanding Environmental Imagination

This strand foregrounds Indigenous understandings of creativity as relational and Queer ecologys challenge to fixed boundaries, including genre, gender, and "nature" itself.

## Focus

- Listening to stories already present in land, water, and more-than-human beings.
- Questioning "natural" categories that constrain who and what is considered possible.
- Embracing hybrid, genre-crossing forms.

## Practices to try

- Relationship-based freewriting and listening exercises (to be added as dedicated practices).
- Genre-crossing prompts that blend essay, list, lyric, and manifesto.
- Bringing found objects from environments (feathers, receipts, leaves, trash) into writing.

## For instructors

- Centre Indigenous and Queer authors not as side notes but as core to the syllabus.
- Invite students to write from specific relationships (to place, community, story) rather than from abstract authority.
- Question default metaphors in prompts that assume heteronormative or colonial perspectives.

## For solo writers

- Trace your own lines of relation: whose stories, lands, and histories are you writing with?
- Experiment with forms that do not fit neatly into "poem," "essay," or "story."
- Notice where you have internalized ideas about what counts as "natural" and write against them.
