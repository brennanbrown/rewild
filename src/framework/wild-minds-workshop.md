# Wild Minds Workshop: Ecological Approaches to Teaching

This strand turns the creative writing workshop into an ecological, moving, adaptive space rather than a static classroom ritual.

## Focus

- Rotating through campus or neighbourhood microclimates.
- Beginning each session with environmental attunement.
- Using ecological metaphors (succession, cycles, composting) to guide process and feedback.

## Practices and structures

- Weekly attunement: sensory inventory and more-than-human census in each location.
- A rotating set of practices from the [Ecology of Mind](/framework/ecology-of-mind/) and [Nature-as-Text](/framework/nature-as-text/) strands.
- Portfolio-based assessment that values process and interconnected work.

## For instructors

- Use the [Wild Minds Workshop overview](/workshop/) and sessions as a flexible template.
- Document the classs movement through spaces and seasons (photos, maps, collective journals) where appropriate.
- Make space for emotional responses to ecological crisis alongside craft discussion.

## For solo writers

- Adapt the workshop arc to your own life: rotate your writing locations and keep a record of how each place affects your work.
- Treat your own practice as a small, ongoing workshop with the more-than-human world.
