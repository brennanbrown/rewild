# Nature-as-Text: Reading the World Beyond the Page

This strand invites you to treat the environments you inhabit as primary texts. Instead of confining reading to printed pages, you attend to bird calls, traffic noise, HVAC hum, sidewalk cracks, and campus microclimates as sources of meaning.

## Focus

- Developing ecoliteracy through direct observation and field journaling.
- Reading urban, suburban, rural, and interior spaces as equally rich environments.
- Dissolving the boundary between "text" and "context".

## Practices to try

- [Watershed Writing](/practices/watershed-writing/)
- [Succession Writing](/practices/succession-writing/)
- [Field Journal – Nature-as-Text](/practices/field-journal-nature-as-text/)

## For instructors

- Take students outside when possible, but also explore hallways, stairwells, archives, and other indoor ecologies.
- Use field journals to bridge between place-based observation and literary texts.
- Ask students to read course settings (classrooms, transit routes, dorms) as carefully as assigned readings.

## For solo writers

- Keep a small notebook (or digital note) for daily environmental observations.
- Choose a familiar route and walk it as though you were reading a new book.
- Notice how attending to place changes what you bring back to the page.
