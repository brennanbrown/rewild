# Access in Wilderness: Disabled Ecologies and the Writing Body

This strand recognizes all bodies as environmental bodies. Disabled ecologies challenge the assumption that meaningful nature connection requires hiking, climbing, or easy movement through outdoor spaces.

## Focus

- Valuing imagination, knowledge, assistive technology, and micro-environments as valid ecological contact.
- Designing pedagogy from access first, not as an afterthought.
- Understanding classrooms, corridors, hospital rooms, and screens as ecologies.

## Practices to try

- [Freewriting as Rewilding](/practices/freewriting-as-rewilding/) (adaptable to many positions and tools).
- [Succession Writing](/practices/succession-writing/) from a fixed location.
- Future: crip sensory mapping and micro-environment attention practices.

## For instructors

- Ask students about access needs and build flexibility into where and how practices happen.
- Treat seating, lighting, noise, and digital platforms as environmental design choices.
- Frame access solutions as creative, ecological responses rather than compromises.

## For solo writers

- Honour the spaces you actually inhabit as worthy of attention.
- Adapt practices to your own rhythms, tools, and capacities without apology.
- Notice how your bodys ways of moving, sensing, and resting shape your environmental relationships.
