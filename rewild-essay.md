Compost the Workshop: Rewilding Creative Writing in the Anthropocene

# Introduction

I remember the first day of my first creative writing workshop. I sat in a classroom with grey-white walls and fluorescent lights humming overhead. The desks were arranged in a circle, metal frames with plastic tops. The windows were small, high up on the wall. Outside lay Lincoln Park, its grasses and paths visible only if I craned my neck. The instructor handed out syllabi printed on white paper. We would study the masters, imitate their forms, and workshop our pieces in this room for sixteen weeks. I've taken eight creative writing classes in my Undergraduate career pursuing my English Honours BA degree at Mount Royal University in Calgary. Only in one---CRWT 3304 Advanced Nonfiction: Writing Place---was the environment ever deliberately brought up as more than setting, as something alive and consequential. Even then, I experienced my creative writing minor in the stuffy, restrictive brutalist classrooms of Mount Royal University's campus. Never once did we visit Lincoln Park, Charlton Lake, the third-floor greenhouse, the Amphitheater, or the large sprawling sports fields that surrounded us. We sat inside, discussing words on pages about places we weren't in. As I reach the end of my undergraduate degree, I can't help but wonder, why not?

The writing workshop---that sacred, untouchable relic---emerged from Iowa in the 1930's and has calcified into dogma, remaining unchanged for nearly a century (Martin). The physical environment of writing instruction is a container of creative bodies primarily in compliance with literary late-stage capitalism's demands. The workshop as an institution doesn't ignore the environment---it actively severs our connection to it, producing writers incapable of interfacing and responding to ecological collapse. Yet, the mind that writes is never separate from the body that breathes, and that body is never separate from the place it inhabits. In most creative writing pedagogies, we act as though consciousness emerges fully formed from disembodied minds, but "our senses define the edge of consciousness" (Ackerman qtd. in Popova). We teach as though creativity happens despite place rather than through it, not focusing on the immediate, embodied present.

This essay proposes a framework for creative writing pedagogy centering decolonized ecological thinking both metaphorically and literally. Drawing on my experience running the creative writing club at Mount Royal University for the past three years, known as Write Club, along with various Indigenous knowledge systems, Queer ecology, and environmental humanities, I suggest approaches that reframe creative writing as an ecological practice---one where the environment of writing is as crucial as the words that emerge. The framework consists of:

1. The Ecology of Mind: Freewriting as Rewilding Practice
2. Nature-as-Text: Reading the World Beyond the Page
3. Indigenous and Queer Lens: Expanding Environmental Imagination
4. Access in Wilderness: Disabled Ecologies and the Writing Body
5. Workshop Proposal: Wild Minds---Ecological Approaches to Creative Writing

What if we treated the writing mind as an ecosystem that requires careful tending? What if we understood the classroom itself as a habitat? What if we recognized that the walls dividing "creative writing" from "nature" are artificial constructs that can---and should---be dismantled? Creative writing pedagogy needs to recognize the words we write emerge from an interdisciplinary ecology of place, mind, and relationship. Critics might dismiss this as impractical---another demand on overtaxed instructors. But ecological pedagogy isn't about adding; it's about noticing. The environment is already here, already willing to teach. We need only to invite students to attend. There are so many possibilities that can grow in such fertile ground.

# The Ecology of Mind: Freewriting as Rewilding Practice

Back when I lived in Dalhousie, I would kneel in my makeshift garden each spring, fingers dirty and dark with soil. What does it mean to cultivate? Certain plants I place with intention---herbs like cilantro or parsley in neat rows. Others arrive uninvited: dandelions pushing through cracks, white clovers spreading beneath the fence. Gardens grow in planned and unplanned ways, and the best gardens make space and room for both. Our minds work similarly. When we write, we cultivate thought. The traditional workshop pedagogy privileges the well-tended row, the carefully pruned sentence. Ideas are seeds, needing attention to flourish. In this sense, the Iowa workshop doesn't create writers---it creates intellectual groundskeepers tasked with maintaining the manicured lawns of acceptable discourse while exterminating anything threatening overgrowth from boundaries.

Our words emerge from systems far larger than ourselves, our words participate in "networks, relationships, connections and interconnections, interdependence, embeddedness, the dynamic interplay between and among the things of the world, including ourselves" (Schraffenberger 2). Writing happens not in isolation but within these webs---physical, material, embodied. The workshop should honour this materiality. Our bodies write. Our tools carry histories. The matter around us holds agency that acts "without intention or even sentience" (Jones). Each poem or story emerges from these physical realities, these exchanges of energy and matter.

After gardening, I sit on the floor of my bedroom, looking out the window at the pine trees swaying in the wind. No writing happens for a long time. Then, without thinking too much about where I'm going, I begin with the trees---how they bend but don't break, how their needles catch the light. Thoughts follow no structure; instead simply move where they want to move. Some sentences lead nowhere. Others surprise me with their clarity. I just keep writing. This is freewriting.

Peter Elbow describes freewriting as an "organic, developmental process in which you start writing at the very beginning---before you know your meaning at all---and encourage your words gradually to change and evolve" (qtd. in Gilbert 6). Approaching freewriting this way mirrors ecological processes---freewriting creates conditions for unexpected growth. A rewilded garden rejecting rigid control in favour of natural emergence.

Students are intellectually stunted by the constraints of typical writing exercises and imitation assignments---attempts to ventriloquize the canonical (white, male, Western) writers who academia continues to worship. Their writing is systematically broken and contorted into unnatural shapes to fit arbitrary parameters imposed by instructors who mistake conformity for craft. The academy in this sense is not uplifting ecological imagination, instead removing the wild thinking we desperately need in this terminal phase of climate catastrophe. At the beginning of each Write Club meeting, I instead give members permission to write freely, to follow the natural pathways of their thinking. Through this exercise, there is a fundamental shift. The writing is allowed to be more vibrant and honest---more alive. Permaculture offers a useful metaphor here---in permaculture gardens, plants grow in mutually beneficial relationships, supporting each other's needs without outside intervention. A freewriting practice creates an ecosystem where ideas can interact and support each other, developing complex relationships that couldn't be planned in advance. Writing workshops must be reimagined as spaces of cultivation rather than correction. The instructor becomes less a judge and more a gardener---observing what naturally emerges, providing supportive conditions, removing obstacles to growth. "The empowerment of asking your own question and then finding a way to answer it and then sharing that with the world" becomes central to the process (Anand 5).

Rewilding our approach to writing also means acknowledging that creativity follows cycle as nature does. There are seasons of abundant production and seasons of dormancy. Both are necessary. Both deserve respect. The fallow field is not empty, but regenerating. The writer going on walks or staring out the window is not idle but gathering. The work happens below the surface, in soil and in thought. Critical walking methodologies offer powerful ways to engage with this process, as they involve "an ethical and political accountability and responsibility for how we walk, who walks, and where we walk" (Springgay and Truman 172). Such practices can lead to "thinking-making-doing" connecting us deeply to place and generating new creative possibilities. 

That said, the act of walking being academically theorized and justified with scholarly citations is the issue with current writing pedagogy. Bodily alienation to the point where the act of moving through space while thinking---something we have done without PhD dissertations for hundreds of thousands of years---must be recuperated through academic jargon to be considered legitimate. The workshop's pathological fear of the moving body, the insistence on containment and immobility, is disciplinary control disguised as pedagogy. The current workshop demands sitting motionless in uncomfortable chairs under fluorescent lights---docile, sedentary bodies disconnected from the intelligence of movement. The revolutionary act isn't theorizing walking but refusing to stay seated in the first place. The path toward environmental consciousness runs through our bodies and minds first, then language. 

Ecoliteracy involves both "ecological awareness" and "thinking about language, learning, and culture in an ecological fashion, viewing society as an ecosystem" (Gilbert 2-3). Creative writing opens unique doorways here, allowing us to "forge new modes of thinking about the environment" and giving "space to 'grow' creative solutions" in ways other forms of writing cannot access (Gilbert 3). Simple practices build this awareness. Freewriting becomes "a form of ecoliteracy because it enables the writer to start building an ecological picture of their mind and world" (Gilbert 6). Through these unfiltered flows of language, writers begin mapping their place within larger systems, noticing connections previously invisible.

When my garden looks messy to the neighbors---violets spreading across the lawn, volunteer sunflowers leaning at odd angles---I think about the birds and insects finding food there. The soil building beneath the chaos. I've come to see beauty in this wild arrangement, to value what emerges without my planning. Writing practices deserves the same patience, the same trust in natural processes. It is the same for the practices of students. Creating the conditions for growth, and then stepping back and watching, is sometimes the most effective approach in both pedagogy and horticulture. 

# Nature-as-Text: Reading the World Beyond the Page

On mornings I walk to campus, I notice crows gathering on a telephone wire---glossy bodies like punctuation marks against the gray sky. I watch for a while and try to read their arrangement, the cawing calls to one another, the way they tilt heads to observe me observing them.What if this, too, was a text worth studying? What if the primary "reading" in a creative writing course happened not only through books but through direct engagement with the world?

"Ecoliteracy fosters in students and academics the ability to make decisions in the context of wider social, economic and environmental considerations," but developing this literacy requires more than theoretical knowledge---it demands attentiveness to the places we inhabit, a willingness to let these places speak (Gilbert 4). Sit outside and write, sink into the silence, the birdcalls, the wind moving through trees, strangers laughing in the distance, traffic humming beyond the boundary. When you finally write, you will write specificity, embodiment, presence. You will respond to the actual world surrounding you, not an abstract prompt. The sounds, smells, movements, textures. When the place becomes the reading, the writing will emerge from that reading.

Apala Bhowmick describes a similar exercise with her undergraduate students, explaining how the students "are expected to observe the natural environment surrounding us, by being alert to their tangible experiences of encountering natural phenomena (plants, in this instance) and write down these observations as a coherent body of text" (3). Field journals became entry points into deeper ecological awareness. Approaching nature-as-text acknowledges what Indigenous knowledge systems have always understood---that the land itself contains stories, that it speaks if we learn to listen.

What does it mean to "read" place as text when our literacy has been systematically destroyed by institutional education? The typical writing student has been rendered functionally illiterate to the living world. A student learns to analyze the metrical variations in a sonnet but cannot recognize bird languages or read the testimony of wind in leaves. A student learns to critique character development but remain blind to the characters that surround them daily---the oak's patient storytelling, the crow's trickster rhetoric. This profound illiteracy is the deliberate product of educational systems designed to sever relationship, to produce writers who mistake the map for the territory, who worship the text while desecrating the world that makes all text possible. The environmental crisis is, at its root, a crisis of perception that the traditional workshop actively worsens. We must, too, expand our definition of "environment" beyond romanticized pastoral wilderness. The urban street, the liminal suburban mall, the classroom itself---all environments are worth reading. A flickering fluorescent light can inspire as much as a forest. The hum of HVAC systems, the scent of disinfectant, the way shadows pool in stairwells---these too are texts. To write from place is not to fetishize a pastoral "nature" but to dissolve the myth that any space is inert.The crows on the telephone wire. The dandelion pushing through sidewalk cracks. The way light falls through a window onto desks arranged in rows.

Our attention must extend beyond the page into the environmental imagination, a capacity to perceive and respond to the ecological systems we participate in daily, whether we notice them or not. Students should be encouraged to keep field journals. To document bird migrations, seasonal changes, construction sites and human alterations to the landscape. Students should be encouraged to write about their commutes, their homes, the "third place" where they gather. They learn to read these environments not as backdrop but as text---complex, multilayered, meaningful. When returning to traditional literary texts, the attentiveness will be brought back. Thoreau's observations of Walden Pond will reveal 19th century economic systems just as much as nature. Jamaica Kincaid's garden writing will become about colonialism, power, and race. Leslie Marmon Silko's desert landscapes will become about cultural erasure, healing, and Indigenous resilience. Reading the world enriches reading the word. The boundary between text and context dissolves, just as the arbitrary boundary between human and nature reveals itself as cultural construction rather than an objective, absolute division.

# Indigenous and Queer Lens: Expanding Environmental Imagination

The land is not empty. The colonial mindset infecting typical Western writing workshops systematically treats the land as such. I look back at not only my creative writing workshops, but my undergraduate classes in general and see how often we worked from the assumption that the work begins with the blank page---with emptiness waiting to be filled by human creativity. I look back at my creative writing workshops and see spaces where we are indoctrinated into the assumption that creativity is human exceptionalism, that art begins with our Godlike intervention into nothingness. 

How different from Indigenous understanding that creativity instead begins with listening to what's already there. Indigenous environmentalism challenges the foundations of Western creative writing pedagogy. Creative is relational, not an individual achievement. There is no separation between the writer and the world being written about. Profound stories emerge from attention, not invention. 

Plants are storytellers---"our stories say that of all the plants, wiingaashk, or sweetgrass, was the very first to grow on the earth, its fragrance a sweet memory of Skywoman's hand" (Kimmerer 5). Asserting non-human life as being operatives of narrative shifts our understanding of originality. Western creative writing pedagogy emphasizes finding one's "unique voice", telling stories that haven't been told before. From an Indigenous perspective, emphasis is on finding your unique relationship with stories that have always been there, and learning to listen in your own way. As I've engaged with Indigenous literary perspectives through writers like Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, Billy-Ray Belcourt, and Joshua Whitehead, I've come to see how this reframing of creativity as relationship rather than invention opens new possibilities for teaching. What if, instead of asking students to create something from nothing, we invited them to listen to the stories already present in the places they inhabit?

Queer ecology offers a complementary challenge to conventional creative writing pedagogy. Conventional understandings of the naturalization of behaviour and human nature require questioning. Queer ecology reveals how often "nature" has been used to police the boundaries of the acceptable---in sexuality, yes, but also in creativity. The wild garden, in its refusal of rigid categorization or systemic boundaries is inherently Queer. The wild garden of the mind is transgressive, improper, and flourishes with contagious diversity. 

The Queer ecological lens brings the questioning and deconstruction of genre boundaries to creative writing pedagogy. Why exactly must we separate poetry from prose, fiction from nonfiction, academic writing from creative expression? Divisions no different than the division between "natural" and "unnatural" sexualities serve primarily to regulate and control. Queer ecological approaches to writing embrace hybrid forms, cross-pollination between genres, and writing refusing easy categorization. Implicit heteronormativity of traditional writing exercises must also be challenged. How often do prompts about character or relationship default to heterosexual pairings? How often do nature-based prompts reinforce binary gender through metaphors of "mother earth" or by describing certain landscapes as "feminine"? 

There are a multitude of questions stemming from Indigenous and Queer ecological perspectives that can spur freewriting sessions for students, such as:

* What stories does this place hold that aren't written in books?
* How might you write from a position of relationship rather than authority?
* What forms of creativity exist outside human expression?
* How might you listen to non-human voices in this environment?
* What boundaries between genres feel uncomfortable or restrictive to you? How might you cross them?

These questions often lead to writing feeling both more rooted and more liberated---connected to place and community while freed from conventional constraints: Translate bird calls, blend scientific observation with personal narrative, mindfully bring objects from surroundings---feathers, stones, leaves, trash---into the classroom and write from physical contact and connection. The approach changes how students understand the act of writing, shifting the creativity of the exercise from human exceptionalism to the practice of relationship with a more-than-human-world, inviting students to see themselves not as separate from nature, but as part of nature's ongoing creativity. The results will be writing contributing to just and sustainable ways of living. When students begin to see themselves as part of an ecological community rather than separate from it, when they question the boundaries that have been presented as "natural", the capacity for imagination is developed which our current moment so desperately needs.

# Access in Wilderness: Disabled Ecologies and the Writing Body

Traditional creative writing pedagogy treats the body as an inconvenience, something to be transcended through intellect. Yet, the idealized workshop body---able to sit still for hours, process verbal feedback instantly, separate from sensory input---exists for very few. The assumed neutrality of the able body in writing instruction is profound ableism determining who can access creative expression and how that expression is valued. Sunaura Taylor writes in Disabled Ecologies how "\[a\]blebodiedness has largely been seen as a prerequisite for having an authentic connection to the more-than-human world" (66). The conventional workshop reinforces this requirement, privileging those whose bodies allow seamless movement through natural spaces while ignoring how disability can foster unique ecological awareness.

Advocates of outdoor writing pedagogy often inadvertently perpetuate this problem, positioning "nature connection" as inherently requiring able-bodied engagement. The well-intended suggestion to just take students outside ignores the complicated reality outdoor spaces present significant barriers for many bodies. Taylor herself writes how she is "hardly capable of climbing or hiking" (66), yet she describes a profound "crip intimacy" with landscapes transcending physically moving through them. An intimate connection emerges "simultaneously in imagination, knowledge, and shared experience" (79), allowing for deep ecological relationships through alternative pathways.

What might a Crip Ecological approach to creative writing pedagogy look like? First, it would recognize that environmental consciousness flows through diverse bodies differently but equally validly. Accessibility and accommodation must be a design principle, not retrofitted. Students may connect through direct sensory engagement, or through memory, imagination, or theoretical understanding---"disabled people rewrite what an authentic connection to nature is" (Taylor 66) through adaptive strategies. Students can share experiences through communal exchange or engaging with micro-environments accessible from stationary positions. For instance, students with mobility limitations might focus on "tire tracks" in soil---what Taylor cites from disability activist Yomi Wrong as evidence "not of destruction but of belonging" (68). When we understand these marks as ways of "being a part of" rather than separate from the environment, we expand what ecological engagement means. 

Workshop activities might include creating sensory maps of accessible spaces, attending to touch, sound, and smell rather than just visual landscape, or developing collaborative environmental narratives where students contribute observations from different embodied perspectives. Examine how disability justice and environmental justice intersect in local contexts, and use adaptive tools (magnifiers, recording devices, digital platforms) to engage with environments otherwise inaccessible

The Crip Ecological framework demands recognition that all bodies are environmental, regardless of ability. "A crip intimacy... grounded in imagination, knowledge, and shared experience of injury" (Taylor 79) offers profound insight into damaged ecologies. Who better to understand impaired watersheds than those navigating bodily impairment? Who better to imagine adaptive strategies for changing climates than those who adapt to bodily difference daily? Crip Ecology reminds us that dependency isn't failure but relationship---the fundamental condition of all living things. Plants depend on soil microbes. Animals depend on plants. Humans depend on one another. We exist not as isolated individuals but as nodes in webs of interdependence. The myth of the self-sufficient writer venturing alone into wilderness reflects the same harmful individualism that disability justice challenges. Writing itself is always interdependent---drawing on language systems, cultural references, and communities of practice that make individual expression possible. Indigenous knowledge systems recognize the disability justice of care networks in ecological understanding. The three sacred sisters---corn, beans, and squash---grow together in mutual support, no different than creative communities flourishing through interdependence rather than competition. The corn provides structure for beans to climb, beans fix nitrogen for corn to absorb, squash shades the soil for both. No plant is expected to thrive independently. No plant is considered broken for needing support.

This approach challenges the assumption that environmental degradation primarily harms able bodies that become disabled---a narrative reinforcing disability as tragedy. Instead, it acknowledges disabled people have always been part of ecological communities, developing expertise in adaptation, interdependence, and creative problem-solving that environmental thinking desperately needs, as "\[d\]isability perspectives suggest that these endeavors require us to learn to adapt to and care for multispecies disability" (Taylor 105). The essential question isn't whether disability complicates environmental engagement, but rather how disabled perspectives transform our understanding of environments. Crip Ecology recognizes all environments are always-already accessed differently by diverse bodies. The classroom with rigid chairs and fluorescent lighting is an environmental justice issue the way polluted waterways or clear-cut forests are. Spaces enforce norms about which bodies belong and which don't. The conventional workshop's fear of the body---any body that moves, feels, or processes differently---reveals its deeper fear of ecological reality. When we recognize all bodies as ecological bodies, we open creative writing to new forms of environmental relationship based not on conquest or mastery but on interdependence, adaptation, and care.

# Workshop Proposal: Wild Minds---Ecological Approaches to Creative Writing

Traditional Western creative writing workshops have institutional constraints---timetables, room bookings, accessibility requirements, administrative logistics. Such constraints are not neutral facts but structures divorcing writing from embodied experience. A belief that creativity happens in sanitized isolation, disconnected from ecological context. These parameters aren't obstacles to work around---they are the very cage we must demolish. Any ecological approach failing to challenge these fundamental structures merely performs the optics of environmental concern while reproducing the same severed relationship to place that has brought us to the brink of collapse. This section outlines practical methods for implementing an ecological workshop model within typical university settings, with specific attention to accessibility, environmental diversity, freewriting practices, and the integration of environmental humanities thinking into creative pedagogy. 

University campuses contain microclimates remaining underutilized as learning spaces. Botanical gardens, memorial plantings, and ornamental landscapes come to mind, in addition to courtyard, entrance gardens, green roofs, or rain gardens. All of which have ecotones demonstrating human-nature interactions. Beyond this, there are also marginal spaces---the edges of parking lots, drainage areas, and other "leftover" spaces often containing spontaneous vegetation and wildlife. Undesigned areas provide counterpoints to formal campus planning. In regards to accessibility, greenhouse facilities, atria with plantings, or buildings with distinct environmental qualities (historical structures, contemporary glass spaces, basement rooms) offer sensory experiences while remaining protected from weather.

Logistical planning and implementation strategies must be considered for this workshop model. Have students create a map of campus microclimates, develop weather contingency plans for each location, and schedule adventurous locations during favourable weather periods. Ensure seating options or portable seating arrangements, and create an assignment out of conducting accessibility audits of each space. When navigating administration, frame the approach as "place-based pedagogy" when seeking departmental approval. Ensure there is documentation of pedagogical outcomes for assessment purposes, and develop risk assessment protocols for non-traditional teaching spaces. Ensure there are communication channels so students are aware of any location changes.

Each week, the classroom location can be rotated---observe high-traffic human spaces, focused plant spaces, the textual environments of campus archives, water features (ponds, streams, drainage systems), or maintenance and infrastructure areas (such as waste disposal or delivery spaces). Return to the traditional classroom for orientation, synthesis, and reflection.

Before beginning creative practice and craft in each new space, lead a 10-15 minute environmental attunement practice. What is the sensory inventory of the location? Direct attention from the immediate surroundings to the horizon and back, noting how perspective changes understanding. Consider the space's past, present, and future, including both human and ecological histories. Take a more-than-human census and identify non-human presences in the space, from obvious (structures, trees, birds) to easily overlooked (insects, fungi, microorganisms). Have students create quick sketch maps of the space emphasizing their bodily and emotional responses rather than objective accuracy.

Throughout the semester, make note of ecological transitions such as first frost/last frost, the solstice and equinox, and the phenological events of first buds, migrations, and leaf colour changes. Develop methods for recording the workshop's journey through environments and ideas---collect physical artifacts (within ethical and regulatory guidelines) from each site, or have a collaborative field journal with contributions from each student.

The modality of workshopping presented requires different assessment methods honouring the process alongside finished product. Rather than isolated assignments, students could develop interconnected portfolios demonstrating environmental thinking. Develop feedback methods reflecting ecological principles---identify connections within the work to other texts and ideas, discuss how elements function within the ecology of the piece, suggest potential adaptations rather than prescriptive "fixes", and explore the work's contribution to the larger systems of the class and literature.

The workshop unfolds against a backdrop of ecological crisis. Our shared reality carries emotional weight that must be acknowledged rather than avoided. Participants need space "to acknowledge the emotional disturbance, that this anxiety needs to be acknowledged and recognised" (Devery). Writing expresses and processes difficult emotions. Writing names fears, articulates grief, and tracks the emotional terrain of living in troubled times. Writing cultivates resilience, imagines alternatives, and creates connections across differences. The workshop should make room for both---for mourning what is being lost and for envisioning what might yet still be created.

Environmental writing emerges from histories marked by colonization and extraction. Just as "garden imaginaries often reflect colonial perspectives" with "two key gardening traditions... one from the ancient practice of Indigenous gardening and the other emerging from colonisation and subsequent migration" (Bayes 47-48), so too environmental writing often carries these dual lineages. The workshop must remain aware of these histories, questioning dominant Western environmental narratives and prioritize space for marginalized perspectives. The workshop needs to "encourage students to see themselves not simply as individuals but as necessarily integrated members of a wider community and system of social relations" (Shaw and Moriarty 777), and recognize environmental concerns cannot be separated from issues of justice and equity.

Growth needs tending and attention. The workshop should include regular opportunities for participants to reflect on their own development---not through external evaluation but through thoughtful consideration of their changing relationship to writing and to the more-than-human world. These reflections might focus on how their understanding has shifted, how their writing practice has evolved, how they see themselves in relation to broader environmental concerns. As a student noted after such a workshop, "\[i\]n terms of embarking on creative projects, this module has kind of really hammered home how important it can be to be socially responsible, and to write about a relevant issue rather than just writing for the sake of profit" (Shaw and Moriarty 782). This reflection completes the cycle, allowing participants to integrate their learning and carry it forward beyond the workshop's boundaries.

## Techniques for Freewriting as Ecological Practice

1\. Succession Writing

"Ecological succession is the process by which natural communities replace (or 'succeed') one another over time. For example, when an old farm field in the midwestern U.S. is abandoned and left alone for many years, it gradually becomes a meadow, then a few bushes grow, and eventually, trees completely fill in the field, producing a forest. Each plant community creates conditions that subsequently allow different plant communities to thrive. For example, early colonizers like grasses might add nutrients to the soil, whereas later ones like shrubs and trees might create cover and shade. Succession stops temporarily when a "climax" community forms; such communities remain in relative equilibrium until a disturbance restarts the succession process" (Witynski).

In writing, begin with the pioneer stage---fast, unfiltered writing about immediate impressions and raw ideas with no concern for coherence. Use simple language and focus on what's directly observable. Next, begin connecting initial observations, developing minor patterns and relationships. Start forming simple sentences and basic imagery. In the intermediate stage, work with the emerging patterns to develop more complex relationships. Introduce metaphor, deepen descriptions, and allow broader connections to form. Finally, in the climax, integrate the developing elements into a complex whole with multiple layers. Refine language, develop sophisticated connections, and work toward a sustainable ecosystem of ideas.

2\. Watershed Writing 

"A watershed is an area of land through which precipitation and all other surface runoff flows downhill into a common body of water, whether it's a stream, river, lake or ocean. Watersheds can include forests, agricultural lands, cities and various other types of land cover. One of the best ways to think of a watershed is to imagine it as a funnel. The hills, mountains and sloping topography of the watershed represent the walls of the funnel, while the streams and other bodies of water represent the spout. When a drop of water enters anywhere in the funnel, it slides down the walls and concentrates at the spout before flowing out at a single point" (Moore).

Begin with 3-5 "headwater" starting points (single words, observations, memories) at the top of the page. Allow each to "flow" down the page independently, generating its own stream of associations and ideas. Where streams naturally meet on the page, let them combine their flows into larger ideas and connections. Continue until all streams merge into a unified "river" of thought at the bottom of the page. Identify the "delta"---the rich depositional area where the main flow meets new territory For group watershed writing, have each student develop a "tributary" independently, then physically arrange papers to connect their ideas, creating a collaborative watershed map.

3\. Mycelial Networks and Rhizomatic Connections

"When most of us think of fungus, we imagine mushrooms sprouting out of the ground. Those mushrooms are in fact the "fruit" of the fungus, while the majority of the fungal organism lives in the soil interwoven with tree roots as a vast network of mycelium. Mycelium are incredibly tiny "threads" of the greater fungal organism that wrap around or bore into tree roots. Taken together, myecelium composes what's called a "mycorrhizal network," which connects individual plants together to transfer water, nitrogen, carbon and other minerals. German forester Peter Wohlleben dubbed this network the "woodwide web," as it is through the mycelium that trees "communicate" (Holewinski).

Begin with a central idea or image written in the middle of a blank page. As new ideas emerge, write them anywhere on the page, without regard for linear progression. Draw connecting lines between ideas that relate, creating a web-like structure. Label the connections with the nature of the relationship (contrast, similarity, cause/effect, memory association). Continue expanding outward in all directions, allowing the network to grow naturally. Identify "node" points where multiple connections converge---these often become central to developing work. Use mind-mapping software that allows for non-hierarchical connections between ideas, Coggle, Miro, or similar platforms work well for this purpose.  

4\. Composting

"\[Our senses\] take in experience, but they need the richness of sifting for a while through our consciousness and through our whole bodies. I call this "composting." Our bodies are garbage heaps: we collect experience, and from the decomposition of the thrown-out eggshells, spinach leaves, coffee grinds, and old steak bones of our minds come nitrogen, heat, and very fertile soil. Out of this fertile soil bloom our poems and stories. But this does not come all at once. It takes time. Continue to turn over and over the organic details of your life until some of them fall through the garbage of discursive thoughts to the solid ground of black soil ... We aren't running everything, not even the writing we do. At the same time, we must keep practicing. It is not an excuse to not write and sit on the couch eating bonbons. We must continue to work the compost pile, enriching it and making it fertile so that something beautiful may bloom and so that our writing muscles are in good shape to ride the universe when it moves through us" (Goldberg 15).

Select a completed piece of writing that isn't working (student's own or provided example). Physically cut the text into components (sentences, phrases, or individual words). Discard elements that have no energy or potential (typically excessive modifiers, clichés, or vague statements). Arrange remaining pieces in new configurations, allowing unexpected juxtapositions. Add "activator" elements (new sensory details, action verbs, concrete nouns) to catalyze new growth. Give time to allow the new arrangement to "cure" before finalizing. Composting teaches that revision isn't merely correction but transformation, and that "failed" writing contains valuable nutrients for new work.  

5\. The Cycles

Cycles are the fundamental rhythms in literature and life. Classical narrative arcs (exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution) map onto seasonal progression. The Western idea of the hero's journey follows the sun's path through solstices and equinoxes---the call to adventure arriving with spring's awakening, the ordeal occurring at summer's height, the return happening as autumn draws boundaries, and the denouement in winter's stillness. The cycle is within the ancient four temperaments---sanguine, choleric, melancholic, phlegmatic. The cycle is within food webs---ideas are consumed, digested, transformed, and released as new energy. Primary producers capture raw energy, primary consumers transform material, secondary consumers refine and concentrate, and decomposers break down completed work to nourish future creation. Think too of the phosphorus cycle, the cycle of precipitation, the process of recycling---the cycle is everywhere.

Spring writing can be thought of as the generative phase---rapid production of new ideas without judgment. Focus on quantity and possibility rather than refinement. Summer writing can be thought of as the development phase---select promising elements from spring writing and develop them with attention to detail, sensory richness, and emotional depth. Autumn writing can be thought of as the harvest phase---critically examine developed material, separating what works from what doesn't. Focus on structure, clarity, and purpose. Finally, winter writing can be thought of as the fallow phase---allow the work to rest. Practice reflective reading of what's been written, making minimal notes for future development, but resisting active revision.

When students write in actual seasonal environments---beneath spring buds, summer foliage, autumn colors, and winter branches---these connections become embodied rather than abstract. A student might complete a short cycle within a single three-hour workshop or extend the process across an entire semester, allowing real meteorological changes to inform their creative development. They learn that the bare winter tree is not a failed summer growth but a necessary phase of becoming, the metaphorical winter of revision is not a creative death but the quiet preparation for new emergence.

# Conclusion

This approach to creative writing pedagogy doesn't abandon craft or critical analysis---rather, it situates these practices within an ecological understanding of creativity itself. Gardens require attention to soil conditions, weather patterns, and interspecies relationships, writing is no different. Writing flourish when we attend to the conditions of its creation.

A creative writing workshop rooted in environmental humanities extends far beyond immediate context. The creative writing workshop isn't contained within classroom walls or limited to the production of texts. True purpose lies in fostering ways of thinking and relating participants carry into their wider lives.The questions it raises persist, which is "\[w\]hat are the materials that I'm surrounding myself with and using to create writing? How does that impact the way I write and what I say?" (Grace T.). Critical questioning bleeds into how we move through the world, what we consume, and our relations to other beings.

The borders between science and art, between objective study and subjective experience, dissolve in the act of writing. When we write with ecological awareness, we discover wholeness beyond artificial divisions. Our writing is inherently interdisciplinary and can contain multitudes, allowing one to "bring everything that I was thinking and knowing and learning, the language and the culture of science... integrate it with all the other parts of my life" where "previously, they felt very separate" (Anand). The integration sits at the workshop's center---creating space where participants bring their full selves: their scientific knowledge, cultural heritage, personal experience, and spiritual understanding into conversation with one another and with the more-than-human world.

Environmental humanities is inherently interdisciplinary. Incorporate expertise from across campus disciplines---partner with the science faculty or work with history or archaeology departments to uncover site histories. Students can identify a campus expert in a field related to environmental understanding (botanist, geologist, facilities manager, campus planner) and develop interview questions connecting this expertise to creative practice. Interviews can be conducted with insights woven into a creative nonfiction piece.

Bringing artists and scientists together in the right environment can lead to "exciting things" happening (Flint). Reconstructing the creative writing workshop as an ecological practice---a workshop honouring the wild alongside the cultivated, valuing diversity over monoculture, and recognizing our embeddedness in place---will enable us to discover new forms of writing that help us navigate our precarious environmental moment. The ecological crisis is, at its heart, a crisis of imagination. The ecological crisis is, too, the inevitable result of educational practices systematically destroying imagination, replacing it with the sterile mimicry the workshop rewards. We need to recognize that the conventional workshop actively produces ecological illiteracy, training writers to ignore the more-than-human world except as a decorative backdrop. As our forests burn and oceans acidify, creative writing programs continue churning out graduates expert in crafting sentences about imaginary human dramas remaining blind to the actual apocalypse unfolding around them. This is pedagogical failure---complicity in ecocide. Either writing education radically transforms to engage with planetary reality, or it deserves to perish alongside the systems of extraction and exploitation it has served for too long. The rewilding of the writing workshop is not a solution to our environmental crises, but it offers us the ability to grow language, with each other, and with the world. Moving beyond self-expression and focusing our creative imagination on relationships---with human communities, with literary traditions, with the living Earth. Listen beneath the surface noise, attend to what's emerging, write from this place of careful attention. Bring us back to ourselves as creatures, speaking earthly words, telling earthly stories. Because it helps us remember what we've always been part of, even when we forget.

The wild garden of the mind may appear untamed but actually reflects a deeper harmony---honouring both order and chaos, tradition and innovation, human and more-than-human worlds. To teach writing through embodied ecologies is to embrace sympoetic making---stories composted from the eco-logic of place, where rooted creativity thrives not in isolation but in the mycorrhizal networks of shared attention. This is how we compost the workshop---letting old pedagogies decay so new life might sprout in the fertile ground between crowsong and concrete, between breath and soil.
